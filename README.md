# SelfDrivingCar
Self-driving car is a project created and developed to understand and develop the intricacy of car automation and its implementation in modern days, The initial idea was to develop a car that can be driven on the Moon from Earth, which grew from there into our expanding complex vehicle system in our time. Using best modern and up to date software and hardware technologies of autonomous cars, I built an RC sized autonomous car using Raspberry pi 4 as the main foundation of the project, attached to it a rotating camera and ultrasonic sensor, mechanically controlled using two engines attached together using 3D printed material. The software side was developed using Python as the main programing language, using open CV to train the AI. In this project the car will be able to identify basic road signs, and react accordingly, follow road lines and not drift apart, and detect obstacles along the way so it can react accordingly.
